<h3 class="center"> Preface </h3>

<p>
Master Lim is a historic figure in the game of Go in France. He taught Go for more than 30 years and was the first high level player in France. The teaching of Master Lim was always orientated towards iintellectual independence, the capacity to develop your own analysis. It is in this spirit, a critical spirit embedded in his way of living, that Master Lim offers his own interpretation of the games of the best players in the world, of which many were played in the quarter-finals of the LG Cup in Paris in November 2000.
<p>
The Ligue de Go d'Ile de France, who act with vigour in the development of Go in France, meet with enthusiasm the publication of this work. It will be a precious aid in the understanding of the game, in particular in its global component, from a distance the most difficult and the most abstract.

<p>
It is completely natural that we begin this series of booklets for the use of Go players with Master Lim. We must thank those who have facilitated the publication of this work through their volunteer work, foremost Dohy Hong for the typesetting and Cyrille Deuss for the diagrams.
<p>
In this ressurection of "Noir et Blanc", Master Lim displays once again his science and his brand of critical analysis. While the professional players are treated without respect, we, the fans of Master Lim know that his intentions are pure. Here the search for the truth comes before superficial images and social conventions. Also, if the shape of this work and the raw language of the author can surprise the neophyte, there is every advantage to work seriously through the diagrams, to follow the invitation of Master Lim to respond to the debate he starts and to accompany him in the incessant quest for the truth.

<h3 class="center">Foreward </h3>

<p>This book is an adventure in the domain of the theory of Go. It invites to the debate players of all levels, and notably the established amateurs. It can not then be excluded that despite the elaborate study of the author, that it contains some technical errors or gaps.

<p>Certainly, to take the risk to find new moves is our privilege to ourselves, the amateurs, and the professionals do not dare to take it lightly, because their life depends on the win or loss of their games.

<p>My dear readers, if you find an error in this book, do not hesitate to protest and present the diagrams supporting your opinion.

<p>For those players at kyu level, the author offers the following advice:

<ol>
<li>It is with a sceptical mind that one must understand joseki move by move; one cannot treat them as absolute truths.

<li>Develop your sense of global fuseki, it is this which is the most important; tsumego, tesuji and yose are auxiliary elements.

<li>Beware of that charasmatic spirit which haunts you: Go is a rigorous science.

<li>At your level, it is very difficult to study the games of professionals, but you must sense their errors : doubt is the beginning of science.

<li> You must always strive to hold an indepedent mind, never dogmatic, it is this which form your capacity to judge. Even the best professionals often commit unthinkable errors; the structure of the human conscious is very fragile. The one who is alert to his own errors is intelligent.
</ol>

<h1 class="solidBorder">I.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Game: C.&#354;&#259;ranu against H.Pietsch</h1>
</div>

<p>This is a game between &#354;&#259;ranu C&#259;t&#259;lin (4th dan pro. Romanian of the Nihon Ki-In) and Hans Pietsch (4th dan pro. German of the Nihon Ki-In), which was broadcast by the NHK and published in Go-Weekly on 17/01/2000.

<p>Black ought to have continued the joseki 27->47. Next, 27, 28 ->49. 30 is premature (30->49). One has the impression that the two players play without direction. 64 is premature: 64->104. If Black had played 65 at 66, the game would be over. 73 is negative. Finally, Black won. It is not a good game: coherent, but aleatory.

<p>Honinbo Jowa said: "The essential technical skill in Go is to know to judge the knub of a game in the thirty or fifty opening moves of the game". If we play badly in the beginning, then there will be nothing good to follow. According to Master Go Seigen, the young Shuei, 19th Honinbo, conceived of ten thousand fuseki to employ against the 18th Honinbo Shuho. Inspired by Shuei, Master Go Seigen conceived hundreds of fuseki, and now once more, he works with energy (<i>A way of play for the 21st Century</i>).

<p>It's a real shame, it is not uncommon these days to find bad moves played by professionals even in the first twenty moves of their game. Utaro Hashimoto (old 9th dan, rival of Go Seigen) said "he who plays a single good game in the whole of his life is one of the best professionals". He recalled "One day in the winter of 1944, when the was in the Pacific had turned bad for Japan, somewhere in Tokyo, in a cold room without coal, without sponsor, I played a game with Go Seigen, and I won with White by a point without counting the komi. IN this game, there was no bad move neither by White nor by Black, so there was nothing to criticise. For all the rest, all my other games are so bad that the disgust me to the point of nausea. Ah, what shame!". What is then the philosophy of Go? It's to learn to be ashamed of yourself. 

<p class="break-after"><!-- pagebreak --></p> 

<p>That is to say, at the level of confuciusism, a rigourous sense of self criticism to recognize errors.

<p class="center">	*	*	*
	
<p>At the start of this game, White made grave errors. But, Black has not taken them into account, he has not punished them. The author will demonstrate in a cartesian manner that Black can win by fifteen points without taking any risk.

<p><b>Fig. 1:</b> In casting an eye over the opening up to move 18, the author detected a bad sign for White, and an idea came to him in a flash, because Black has built the wall 7-17 in sente, and the shape 8-18 is thin (usui). Furthermore, move 6 is questionable. First of all, setting Fig. 1 to one side, we should more closely examine this move.

<p><b>Dia. 1:</b> <i> The origin of 6 in Fig. 1. White: Cristian Pop, Black: C&#259;t&#259;lin &#354;&#259;ranu, Fujitsu 1997. 9 is a funny move (c.f. Dia. 2).</i>
<p><b>Dia. 2:</b> <i> In playing 9, Black should push White against the black shimari. Next, he must play 11 as a pincer.</i>

<p><b>Dia. 4:</b> <i> If Black makes tsuke at 10, we envisage play up to 15. Owing to the presence of 7, there is no question of shicho. There are other variations: Dia. 5,6,7,8,9.</i>

In contrast, if the shicho doesn't work, it is catastrophic for Black. But, later, according to the play, if Black finds a favourable solution to the shicho for himself, he will not hesitate to play 7 in Dia. 10.</i>

<p>For the moment, the provisional conclusion of move 6 (Fig. 1) according to the author, is that it is a slow move or perhaps obscure.

<p>The second important point in the game is that characteristic of "Tasuki" fuseki (literaly: two cords which cut the jacket diagonally from the shoulders to the knee, a fighting shape). With Tasuki, in the opponent's corner, it is better not to play a large joseki, because the latter brings two sources of anguish: ko and shicho. In the real game, White allowed Black to create a wall in sente; it is the first error of White. The second is to have neglected to check diagrams 4 to 10, and notably diagram 10.


<p>Where should White play 6? The author advices to play 6 at A in Fig. 1 to invite Black into a real fight. In this case, Black should not play 7 at B (Dia. 11, 12), nor at C (Dia. 13).

<b>Dia. 12:</b> <i> The more Black continues in this sequence, the worse it gets. The overconcentrated black shape is ridiculous.</i>
<br>
<b>Dia. 13:</b> <i>This position is quite nice for White. 6 is well placed. There are other choices for Black. If Black plays 7 at D in Fig. 1, White 8 at C. If Black 7 at E, White F (Dia. 14).</i>

This series of a dozen diagrams is a study, a preparation, indispenable to predict the key issue of the game with any theoretical conviction. Go is a cartesian science.

White, having finished in sente in the north-west corner, should take the initiative in the east, because this resion will be the first front while the north-east corner is a secondary front. Who will play first in the east side? It is very urgent, more urgent than we think.

<p>Suppose that, despite the humiliation, White must play 24. The move 25 of Fig. 2 seems slow and too prudent, but in reality, it has three objectives: to construct an indestructible fortress, to make an extension at B and eventually invade at 27. White is obliged to play on the north side of the board, not close to 25: either 26, or C. Dia. 7 is unthinkable.

<p>Before returning to the game, let us make a summary of what we have studied.

<p><b>Dia. extra:</b> <i>It is the opinion of the author: 6->A, 7->B, 8->16, 10->C, 12->D, 18->E.</i>

<p>After 19, White has little choice globally. Notably, when playing 23, there are some global variations: a san-san in the north-east corner, or one in the south-west (less probable). The others are unthinkable. Even though we've played under 25 moves, the variations are very limited. The author has thus tried to confirm the defeat of White in a cartesian manner.

<p><b>Fig. 3:</b> What is the global situation? The white territory in the south-east corner is well defined, about 35 points. The black territory in the north-east is evaluated at 45-50 points. After 45, the black territory in the south-west corner equals 20 points. The white territory on the west of the board comes to a little more than 15 points after 46. If White takes the initiative in the north of the board, this will make 20 points. For the moment, it is quite fragile. Everywhere, the black groups are robust. Moreover, it is Black to play. The author "scents" that Black is ahead by a 15 points. 41 is the biggest point. If White plays 44 at A, what to do? (Dia. 17).

<p><b>Dia. 17:</b><i> It is a undesirable gote sequence for White. After having played 6-8, White plays 10.</i>

<p>After 45, 46 is the biggest; in playing that White threatens the black wall. 47 is forced. If Black omits this move, White will play it; the difference is enormous. In place of playing 46, if White plays 47, what will happen? (Dia. 18).

<p><b>Dia. 18:</b> <i>After 2, White must play 3; he can not play at A. Then, Black plays 4. After the consolidation, Black will look for a chance to play at B.</i>

<p class="break-after"><!-- pagebreak --></p> 


<p>It is urgent for White to play 50. To answer at 52 is pathetic and miserable. To help the isolated black stone, it is better to attack 50 from behind. White resists. 53 forces 54. At this stage, for Black, there is only one marvellous move. Go is a dream. Between dreams and reality, there is an unbridgable chasm. Nevertheless, it is better to dream: 55. The center is a minature map of the Pacific Ocean. The author remembers the naval combats, - at the Coral Sea, Midway, Solomon, Guam, Saipan -, for White the only thing is to penetrate the gaps. Where? Just 56.

Dia. 21: This sequence is less brutal than the two before. But the capture of two white stones after 24 is too big.

Dia. 22,23: The move 1 is also possible. it would be better to play 16 at 17 (Dia. 24).

Dia. 24: It is not worth playing 25-27; Black can only play 33 (All this is superfluous for established players, but it has educational value for weaker players, so the author continues).

Fig. 4: For White, there is only one possible chance for victory: 81. If he plays it, because of the meanace of White A, the advantage of Black is considerably diminished. But not right now (Dia. 25).

Dia. 25: There is no trouble here.

Looking with a coveting eye the black territory is equivalent to 50 points, White plays 80. It is the moment for Black to play 81. White seeks compensation in playing 82. Black, leaving it, moves to the north-west corner.

Fig. 5: If White plays 4 at 5, Black 5 at 7. 10 is necessary. Black has to right to play 17 at 18, because of the warikomi at A. 21-23 equals 10 points in gote.

If White plays 23, in place of 20, is the advantage of Black diminished? The move doesn't change much (Fig.5b, Fig.6b). Why continue the game? To know by how many points Black wins.

The author admits that he is unskilled in yose. The readers should verify by themselves.

Fig. 6: Black leads by 20 points.
Fig. 5b and Fig. 6b: Black leads by 19 points.

<p>While I looked at the sequence of 1-18 in figure 1, an idea suddenly came to me, until move 27: "Black is ahead by 15 points, the equivalent of a corner shimari." Without a serious preliminary study of what is happening on the east of the board after move 6 (Dia. 1-10, which the author hopes contain no errors), this intuition would not have appeared. Since that time, I have been obsessed by the need to verify my analysis, thus I am afraid of lacking impartiality and of having preferred Black. I've tried to do my best to neutralize this involuntary favouritism. During move than 45 days, I conceived in excess of 200 diagrams of which I removed the majority.

<p>I imagine the case of Newton, since he watched "the apple fall" and he doubted something, he worked on the subject for a long time, energetically, never letting go of his intuition, in the spirit of a "pit bull". The author wishes to find "the diary" of Newton.

<p>The same with Madame Curie; in observing the light of radium in the shadows, she decided to find the source of the light. Is this not then an obsession or better a stubborness of two scientists?

<p>In answering a question posed by a journalist regarding sound and fury, William Faulkner said: "To write energetically about human folly until the end, it is my obsession".
	
<p>An old german chemist succeeded to invent a medicine against syphillus called "606". For the 606th experiment, he came again.

<p>For my part, during more than a month and a half, I experienced this sentiment. Stubborness, is it not the backbone of human enterprise? without any doubt, Go is a science, moreover it gives us a moral lesson on what hard science does not bring to us: "to learn to have a sense of shame" and "to know how to rid oneself of prejudice". On the latter point, if we make a mistake in direction on the goban, to realise our error an to correct it, that takes a lot of time; for the authot, 3-4 days to a week to correct a simple error. Go is at times a hard science and a human science. The hard science of go is not a philosophy, but it is a technique underpinned by a moral philosophy.

<p> The people from Marseille (seminar 19/03/2000) and from Montreuil (seminar 01/04/2000), were completely dumbfounded by my astounding speech, their moves gaping without movement, languid, grumbling: "It is not clear. I am not convinced."

<p> The author told himself: "It is completely normal, in more ways than one". This is not a one night spectacle. To try to understand, one must work and suffer. It is for that purpose that I had distributed photocopies of the game to the participants, 8 days in advance. Even though I never stop reproducing diagrams, even for myself, the conceived course sometimes seems impossible and unreal like in a science fiction novel or a detective novel. The impression must be stronger for the others. I wish for my readers to find potential errors in this article. I repeat that to protest against the author, one must absolutely present the diagrams to justify your opinion. Else, all is prejudiced. On the goban, the author has a good move, and the architect of a bad move does not exist. There are truths, and there are falsehoods.

<p class="center">	*	*	*
			
<p>Secondly, we are morons, Ewan-Ken-Ken. We are neither monkey not parrot. One must doubt, and be suspicious of what seems to be accepted wisdom. Doubt and suspicion are the starting point of all science. Doubt consists of the search for errors, and the science is to analyse and correct them with an independent spirit; it is the one true study.

<p>In passing, the author has something to add on the notion of "an independent spirit". Firstly the case of Sartre; the author supposes that he does not like the word independence, because for him it signifies implicitly the existence of an Other (to be supreme or master) who dominates the spirit. He preferred the german word, "Selbstandigkeit" (self-standingness, to stand on a firm footing)
This word is more energetic than independence. Secondly, Confucius has said "Aged thirty, I stood up firmly" (Analects of Confucius). Yet another wise man: Buddha. He advised his students: "Find your spirit, shape your spirit" (Sati Patt Hana). They are all atheists, and very lucid. The author belongs to that family.			

<p class="center">	*	*	*

			
<p>Is Go useful? Manifestly, the theory of gravitation and the discovery of radium were useful for humanity. Go is a block of wood and pebbles. Confucius said "The wise man (junzi) should not play Weichi. He should work for the betterment of humanity. If a sweet little thing (xiao ren) plays Go, she will not have the time to do pointless things". The author dares to say that Go is a cultural parasite. Often he is known for his inane sentiment. He lost his will to continue the study of Go at this level after one and half months. Go is a vain passion. At the end of the day, it may be the same with life.

<p> Here are three games from the international LG Cup played on 14/11/2000 at the H&#244;tel Lut&#233;tia, Paris.

<p> Among the four games in total, there was only one good game (Lee Se Dol - Rui Nai Wei). All the other three were abominations, and there is nothing further to add. The author repeats again "the spirit of Go is to learn to have a sense of shame". It is for everyone. Confuscius said "When a man makes a mistake, we see his character","What cateogry of mistake?","When we have made a mistake, do not hesitate to correct yourself." It is self rigour, the sense of autocritic. It is that which corresponds to a commentary on a game of Go, without exception to the whole. An error committed should be a good lesson to learn for the future.

<p><b>Fig. 1:</b> 29 is good timing. The double cut 19-28-31-32 is gote for White. 46-47 hints at an important ko battle. By 53, Black prepares an intrinsic ko menace. By consequence, White should play 46 at 52 (Dia. 7).

<p><b>Fig. 1:</b> 75 is a nice move. 82 is forced. in playing 83 must say to himself that he has won. At the stage of 121, Black is twenty points ahead. White resigns after 197.

<p> The style of Ma is very intelligent, according to what they say; he counts the points precisely. At the start of the game, he tries everywhere to win points in sente (move 16), and to erode the opponent's moyo from "a height" (move 22), while leaving bad aji at the same time. 16 is an unthinkable mistake for his level. In this game, he dazzled himself with his own intelligence.

<p>S&#233 Dol does not know how to submit; his style resembles Hononbo Shuei, or better that of Sakata "teeth gritted". It is inspiring. His motto in Go is "absolute conviction of victory". There we may recall the moral of Japanese officers in the jungles of the Pacific. His character diametrically opposes that of Lee Chang Ho who resembles a little bhikku or better an inscrutable Chinese. As I hear it, the two boys will face each other as finalists in the L.G. Cup. Rui Nai Wei has already said that in the future, S&#233 Dol will be a candidate to replace Lee Chang Ho.

<p> Rui chooses a strategy of karami (attacking two groups). Under these conditions, we would say that this a game whose result walks on a tightrope; if one slips from the thread, one lands at the bottom of a precipice.

<p> Move 79 is forced. In playing 76-80-84, white escapes from the danger zone. 91 is a questionable move; black should play somewhere close to hoshi on the north of the board. 93 is forced else white tsukekoshi at A.

Since then, he has won the intrinsic right to criticise everyone else, and so, he terrorizes all the troublemakers.

<p>In mid January 1999, M. Takemiya payed a visit to the Centre culture du Japon in Paris to assist with the first game of the Kisei-sen between Cho Chi Kun and Koichi Kobayashi.	 The author had the temerity to ask of the promoter of the cosmic style his personal opinion on the Chinese fuseki of Lee Chang Ho; he was prudent. Simply, he said: “Evidently, Lee Chang Ho is the world number 1”. The author said to him that one day we will find a good measure against the Chinese fuseki of Lee.

<p>Cho Hun Hyun and Yoo Chang Hyuk (Number 3 korean) I believe to be capable of finding an answer which is 100% impeccable. But Lee takes a road in another plane. Cho is not able to stop the march of his pupil. In the whole ensemble of this character of this quiet, unshakable boy like a stone Buddha, his master sensed, felt an unearthly presence.

<p>Furthermore, on another subject, Takemiya consented to the author of this article “joseki favourite of Kato”.

<h3>V.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseki favourite of Kato the “killer”</h3>

Diag. 2.1: After 9, Black often, without answering to this, plays elsewhere. Let us suppose that under these conditions, White takes an initiative (Diag. 2.2).

Diag. 2.2: If Black plays 18 at 19, White 20 at 23, Black 21 at A, White 22 at 29, Black 23 at 18, White 24 at B. This shape is an insupportable humiliation for Black (potius mori quam foedari, death before dishonour). So, Black chooses the path in this diagram. It is a terrible ko, which decides the whole game. One cannot start it without making a global judgement; that is to say that move 1 is shobute (alea jacta est). When the author showed Dia. 2.3 to Takemiya he cried “Ah! … ”

Diag. 2.3: “Master Lim, did you find move 18 by yourself?” “Oui.” “Amazing! I never thought of it.” M. Kataoka (9th dan pro) interrupted, and he showed the following: 19-20. He said “17 is not bad, Hanedashi 1 in Dia. 2.2 is not shobute. Therefore, this is Kato’s favourite joseki no more”.

When the author showed this diagram to Master Cho Hun Hyun on his visit to Paris, in summer 1999, he was silent. “He who says nothing agrees”. But on another joseki subject, I could not persuade him, nor could he persuade me (c.f. Dia. 3.1-3.4).

Before speaking of other questionable fuseki-joseki, to persuade the readers, the author adds an explanatory diagram (Dia. 2.4).

Dia. 2.4: 24 is a good flexible move, after 24, 5 white stones are moribund.

<h3>V.3  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The origin of a debate on a classic joseki</h3>

Dia. 3.1: This joseki was played for the first time in a game of the 13th Honinbo-sen between Takagawa (Black) and Sugiuchi (White) on 01/09/1958. As soon as we decided it was unfavourable for White, we stopped playing it.

Dia. 3.2: This sequence replaced it, but there is a source of anguish in the shicho, if Black plays 12 at A. If the ladder is bad for Black, he is obliged to play in another way, that is to say, Black at B, White at C, Black at D and White at E. And then we can make several corollary joseki. For the author all this is hollow reasoning (Dia. 3.3).

Dia. 3.3: In this sequence, the move 10 removes said joseki; after 10 it is no longer a question of shicho, because White is obliged to play 11 or 12 (Dia. 3.4).	

Dia. 3.4: We expect this diagram. For White, there is nothing good.

During his invited-stay in Tokyo, Mr Denis Feldmann posed this question to several pros. To his surprise, nobody had imagined move 10 in Dia. 3.4. He recounted: “They said in unison that for Black, Dia. 3.1 is a little better than Dia. 3.3, because 10 in Dia. 3.1 takes a liberty from the 2 white stones”. What a funny argument! Is this not an annoying and painful justification? Later can White attack this strong black group? That could be possible. According to the changing external situation of the black group, he could be obliged to remove the 2 white stones but tomorrow is too late.

This way of speaking can be traced back to the “self-justification” of the collective. When the author began to talk of this Limesque joseki (Dia. 3.3), apart from Mr André Moussa, everyone stood against Mr Lim: Farid Ben-Malek, Pierre Colmez, Guo Juan, Saijo Masataka and all the asian pros who had come to France.

Concerning this, we must state that in Dia. 3.1, there is an intrinsic ko threat, but that in Dia. 3.3 there is none. The pros have admitted, however, still according to Feldmann, that 10 in Dia. 3.3 removed the problem of shicho, in contrast with the 2 prestigious pros, Cho Hyun Hun and Otake Hideo, who discarded the thorny problem of the shicho. Later, disillusioned with the joseki of Dia. 3.3 Farid, invited to the Nihon-Kiin, posed this question face to face with Master Otake. The latter had never thought of move 10 in Dia. 3.3, recounted Farid.

Intelligence arrived with a lie (Laotseu). One must understand well “Candide” by Voltaire.

In general, amateurs always keep their charismatic spirit comparing to pros, while the lesser pros have the tendency to have confidence in the classic theories without verifying them; the first reflex is the mother of religion and the last is conservatism or better the traditionalism which blocks scientific development. The belief of the person obscures their vision. Among the strong persists a mentality of contempt sometimes conscious sometimes unconscious against the weak. To find the errors, we must have the candor of a child, to correct them, we must have the courage of a tiger.

There are still others. This time, we speak about a fuseki.

<h3>V.4  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  An other example of fuseki</h3>

Dia. 4.1: This fuseki was in fashion during a certain time. It is White to play. It does not seem to the author that after this giant joseki, the game is good for black for three reasons: first, the black territory in the south of the board is not yet closed; secondly, some life still remains with the stone at 14; thirdly, the white territory in the south-east corner represents a good dozen points.

The author of this article proposes his own bold opinion (Dia. 4.2).

Dia. 4.2: 13-14 are forced. At move 15, White should not play 16 at A; if White does, Black B, White C, Black D, White E and Black 18.

At first sight, this manner of playing for Black has a brutal air. Mr Ouchi David Chinese interrupted to speak against “this brutality”: “Mister Lim, this sequence has no finesse or subtlety, is it not so?” “Well, I purposely borrowed the Chinese peasant style.” “No, it is not the Chinese peasant style. All the moves are like the steps of a gorilla or a badger.” “I do not like moves which are sophisticated but useless, twisted and complicated, and lacking of any sense.”

Last year, at Sanhilac, the author showed this idea to Mister Shim and Yoo (2000 Korean amateur champion) and we reached the same conclusion (Dia. 4.2). They said that if Black plays 11, there is no other choice but the diagram. The author said to Mister Yoo (who holds in esteem the style of Moussa) that we (the author and Moussa) should no longer play 8, and that we should play 11. Mister Yoo agreed.

For the kyu players, the author adds a superfluous diagram.

Dia. 4.3: We arrive at 27. Then, White cannot play 22 at 23, nor 24 at 25 (verify this). The white territory on the east of the board represents 20 points, while the black moyo represents a scale model of the Grand Canyon, Arizona.

Lastly, another joseki which seems questionable for the author.

<h3>V.5	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An other example of joseki </h3>

Dia. 5.1: This diagram is of a game from the 2000 French Championship.11 is premature; normally we play 11 at 13 (Dia. 5.2).

Dia. 5.2: 13 is forced, if not White plays at A. The sequence up to 13 is a model joseki.

Dia. 5.3: The three white moves shape form a beautiful landscape. 13 is basically forced locally. Then, white has an easy continuation.

Dia. 5.1: After 12-13, the game will be rather stormy, because according to what happens in the north-east corner, if the black group 7-9-11-13 is consolidated, Black will make the wariuchi invasion in the west of the board. Yet amusingly, in the north-east corner an abnormal event is produced. Allowing the moves up to 26, Black should have played 27 at 32. The author does not accept as joseki the sequence 20-25. Black has a good way to devalue 14-20. The author expressly does not reveal it to maintain its instructional value. My readers who find a good idea, may express it directly to Master Lim. To find a good move, you must suffer alone. The problem has been set, the response already found 60% of the time.

<h2>Notes on this Translation</h2>

<p>I first heard of Ma&#238;tre Lim in Cambridge Go Club, at the Graduate Cafe, where Charles Matthews related how Lim Yoo Jong had once called him a pig. I have only seen Ma&#238;tre Lim once. That was at the Paris Open in 2005. The image of this rather frail long bearded man, nattering over a cup of tea with Yuki Shigeno was not something that inspired awe in me. Nor did it convey his celebrated brutality. Nonetheless, I noticed that he <i>still</i>[1] commanded a certain respect amongst his peers. On finding this booklet, I saw in its translation an obvious opportunity to study both language and Go. I embarked upon the task with a certain interest in what the man had to say, and I hope, dear reader, that you too can find some interest there. You will not find a beautiful translation, but then you shouldn't have expected to, should you?

<p>The work was originally published as an A5 booklet by the Ligue de Go d'Ile de France in November 2001. This publication of this translation was kindly sponsored by the Irishi Press. It is dedicated to Matthew.

<h2> Notes on Ma&#238;tre Lim </h2>
<p>It would be thoughtless of me to attempt a biography of the man. I will just offer some trite sentences. Although I have translated his name as Master Lim, it was as Ma&#238;tre Lim that he was of course known. He was born in what is now North Korea, in the year 1924. Moving through China and Malaysia, he settled in France, where he lived until his death in 2016. It is often stated that he was responsible for developing Go in France. Fr example, one of his pupils became European Champion, he co-authored several popular manuals on the game, and indeed he was awarded the Médaille d'Or de la Jeunesse et des sports for his work in 1994. Go in France still remembers him.

<p>[1] As a Druout once wrote "<i>..well, I played with him once</i>".
