Preface

Master Lim is a historic figure in the game of Go in France. He taught Go for more than 30 years and was the first high level player in France. The teaching of Master Lim was always orientated towards iintellectual independence, the capacity to develop your own analysis. It is in this spirit, a critical spirit embedded in his way of living, that Master Lim offers his correct interpretation of the games of the best players in the world, of which many were played in the quarter-finals of the LG Cup in Paris in November 2000.

The Ligue de Go d'Ile de France, who act with vigour in the development of Go in France, meet with enthusiasm the publication of this work. It will be a precious aid in the understanding of the game, in particular in its global component, from a distance the most difficult and the most abstract.

Frédéric Renaud
President de la Fédération Francaise de Go

It is completely natural that we begin this series of booklets for the use of Go players with Master Lim. We must thank those who have facilitated the publication of this work through their volunteer work, foremost Dohy Hong for the typesetting and Cyrille Deuss for the diagrams.

In this ressurection of "Noir et Blanc", Master Lim displays once again his science and his brand of critical analysis. While the professional players are treated without respect, we, the fans of Master Lim know that his intentions are pure. Here the search for the truth comes before superficial images and social conventions. Also, if the shape of this work and the raw language of the author can surprise the neophyte, there is every advantage to work seriously through the diagrams, to follow the invitation of Master Lim to respond to the debate he starts and to accompany him in the incessant quest for the truth.

Foreward

This book is an adventure in the domain of the theory of Go. It invites to the debate players of all levels, and notably the established amateurs. It can not then be excluded that despite the elaborate study of the author, that it contains some technical errors or gaps.

Certainly, to take the risk to find new moves is our privilege to ourselves, the amateurs, and the professionals do not dare to take it lightly, because their life depends on the win or loss of their games.

My dear readers, if you find an error in this book, do not hesitate to protest and present the diagrams supporting your opinion.

For those players at kyu level, the author offers the following advice:

1) It is with a sceptical mind that one must understand joseki move by move; one cannot treat them as absolute truths.

2) Develop your sense of global fuseki, it is this which is the most important; tsumego, tesuji and yose are auxiliary elements.

3) Beware of that charasmatic spirit which haunts you: Go is a rigorous science.

4) At your level, it is very difficult to study the games of professionals, but you must sense their errors : doubt is the beginning of science.

5) You must always strive to hold an indepedent mind, never dogmatic, it is this which form your capacity to judge. Even the best professionals often commit unthinkable errors; the structure of the human conscious is very fragile. The one who is alert to his own errors is intelligent.

I. Game: T.Catalin against H.Pietsch

This is a game between Taranu Catalin (4th dan pro. romanian of the Nihon Ki-In) and Hans Pietsch (4th dan pro. german of the Nihon Ki-In), which was broadcast by the NHK and published in Go-Weekly on 17/01/2000.

White: Taranu Catalin
Black: Hans Pietsch
Main Time 1h, byoyomi: 30s/stone.

Black ought to have continued the joseki 27->47. Next, 27, 28 ->49. 30 is premature (30->49). One has the impression that the two players play without direction. 64 is premature: 64->104. If Black had played 65 at 66, the game would be over. 73 is negative. Finally, Black won. It is not a good game: coherent, but aleatory.

Honinbo Jowa said: "The essential technical skill in Go is to know to judge the knub of a game in the thirty or fifty opening moves of the game".

Mistakes

Here are listed the mistakes which I noticed, but did not correct.
