# Lim
A translation of Maitre Lim's booklet Notes sur des parties commentees. Maitre Lim was always a favourite for the Parisian crowd, his acerbic commentary and viewpoints where very much in tune with the spirit of things there. For those others reading, I suppose that they may find this Korean amateur's insights command considerably less inspiration. However, I find them interesting, and that is one reason why I am translating them. I am also translating this work out of a need to practice translation. Naturally, since I am not a perfect translating machine, you're not going to find that this is the most perfect translation in the world. If you did find that, then I wouldn't need the practice.

It is my regret that the diagrams in this work are often rendered as PNG format, it was my own carelessness at work there. Too late did I fail to notice the large difference in quality between SVG and PNG. Backtracking through the diagrams in GoWrite wasn't really the scope of this effort. As such, at times the quality is a little substandard, but I believe that the diagrams are still perfectly readable. As always with GitHub, you have the option to work to improve that.
