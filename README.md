# Lim
A translation of Maitre Lim's booklet Notes sur des parties commentees. Maitre Lim was always a favourite for the Parisian crowd, his acerbic commentary and viewpoints where very much in tune with the spirit of things there. For those others reading, they may find this Korean amateur's insights considerably less inspiring. I am translating this work out of a need to practice translation.
