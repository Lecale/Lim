# Lim
A translation of Maitre Lim's booklet Notes sur des parties commentees. Maitre Lim was always a favourite for the Parisian crowd, his acerbic commentary and viewpoints where very much in tune with the spirit of things there. For those others reading, I suppose that they may find this Korean amateur's insights command considerably less inspiration. However, I find them interesting, and that is one reason why I am translating them. I am also translating this work out of a need to practice translation. Naturally, since I am not a perfect translating machine, you're not going to find that this is the most perfect translation in the world. If you did find that, then I wouldn't need the practice.
